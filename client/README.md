# Frontend Setup Guide

## The process

Before jumping to the code I designed a small sketch to have an idea...

## Getting Started

To run the frontend of this project, follow these simple steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Francisca105/taskmaster_your-ultimate-to-do-list.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd taskmaster/frontend
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Frontend

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can start the frontend server with the following command:

For development:
```bash
npm start
```

For production:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create an optimized production build in the build folder, which you can then deploy to a web server.

This will start the development server and open your default web browser to display the frontend of the application. You can also access it manually by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
